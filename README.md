# The Open-source Research Community in Astronomy (ORCA)

Welcome to the central repository for the ORCA Website. We're a collection of people who believe that astronomy software and its development should be _inclusive_, _transparent_ (where possible), and _collaborative_. 

To learn more about ORCA and how you can get involved, visit [https://orca-astro.github.io/website/](https://orca-astro.github.io/website/).
