This website is meant to serve as a central resource for users and developers of astronomical software. We'll aim to keep this website updated with upcoming workshops and ongoing activities organized by ORCA, along with miscellanous tools that might be useful for beginners to software development. What is ORCA? ORCA was born in May 2022 at a workshop at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. It was formed to cultivate a community, both in and out of academia, that could together push toward equitable, inclusive, and collaborative astronomical software development. ORCA aims to recognize the code contributions that often go overlooked in academic roles. As astronomers collect larger and larger datasets, our study of the universe has become increasingly computational in nature. Recognizing and celebrating the efforts of researchers in this domain is vital for enabling scientific discovery in the years to come. How can I get involved? We have a slack channel, and we welcome you to join the conversation! Please reach out to [who?] if you'd like to be added. Feel free to also check out the pages on the left to learn more about our current activities.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to the landing (breaching?) page for ORCA!
